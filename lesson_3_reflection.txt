When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When more then one person or station is involved in the process. Also a way of backing up code and progress.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It's a good way of keeping the remote directory clean and useable by other people.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks is for "cloning" repositories on github, while keeping the reference to the original. Clones is used to get codes to different machines or folders. Branches would be used when a new feature or segment is developed or tested.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Less conflicts to deal with later on and the recent commits would be available offline as well.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Would have to e-mail files back and forth and renameing folders to keep track of versions, or have a common storage point where the code would be stored. Harder would be to keep changes separete when working on the same parts in the code and easier could be if the project is small.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
