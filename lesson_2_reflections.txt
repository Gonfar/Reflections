-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Init seems to setup the filesystem framework that git needs to be able to handle future commits and actions on the repository.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It gives a overview of the content for the next commit. It helps to minimize the amount of files in a commit. 

-How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

That can be done by adding a file and then making a commit before adding the other files.

-What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would help whenever there is a interest in trying out new additions to the code while still having the option of keeping the original code in working condition for other additions.
