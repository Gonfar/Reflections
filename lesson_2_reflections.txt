-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Init seems to setup the filesystem framework that git needs to be able to handle future commits and actions on the repository.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It gives a overview of the content for the next commit. It helps to minimize the amount of files in a commit.
