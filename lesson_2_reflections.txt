-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Init seems to setup the filesystem framework that git needs to be able to handle future commits and actions on the repository.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It gives a overview of the content for the next commit. It helps to minimize the amount of files in a commit. 

-How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

That can be done by adding a file and then making a commit before adding the other files.
